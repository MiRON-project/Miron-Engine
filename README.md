# Miron-Engine
The Miron-Engine is the adaptation engine and the main repository of the organization. It provides a step-by-step on how to setup the computer and what are the required changes to integrate Miron, RoQME, MOOD2Be and Smartsoft.
Please make sure to read the documentation in the Documentation folder and the tutorials to be able to install all the required components to run the application. The system has several dependencies and one must set up the inter-process communication to be able to run the full system.

Basically, one will need to install the following modules:
- Smartsoft, and switch to the Miron-Organization branch on several repositories, e.g., ComponentRepository, SystemRepository, DataRepository and others.
- MOOD2Be, the BehaviourTree manager
- ZMQ, the inter-process module
- RoQME, the tool to model non-funtional models
- Miron-Engine, the tool for adaptation
- 3rd Party libraries: OMPL, MRQT, Webots for simulation

Please continue the tutorial in the Documentation folder.
