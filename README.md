# The MIRoN Toolchain
This is the main repository of the MIRoN Toolchain, developed as part of the MIRoN Integrated Technical Project (ITP), funded by the H2020 RobMoSys Project (Gran Agreement No. 732410). 

Installing, setting up and using the MIRoN Toolchain requires installing the following modules:

- Smartsoft, and switch to the Miron-Organization branch on several repositories, e.g., ComponentRepository, SystemRepository, DataRepository and others.
- MOOD2BE: BehaviourTree manager.
- ZMQ: inter-process communication module.
- The RoQME Toolchain, enabling the design-time modelling and runtime estimation of QoS metrics define don non-functional properties.
- The MIRoN Toolchain, enabling the modelling of the system variation points (i.e., parameters and alternative/optional behaviours) and the adaptation logic required to configure those variation points at runtime according with the evolution of relevant QoS metrics.
- A number of third party libraries, e.g., OMPL, MRQT or Webots for simulation.

Detailed installation instructions are available in the Documentation folder.
